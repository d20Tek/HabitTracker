# HabitTracker
A habit tracking application that can be used to ensure that you are building and improving your healthy habits.

The initial release is just the HabitTracker.Engine library and implements the different functional use cases, and the HabitTracker.Cli (a command-line tool) to define and track your habits.

Future releases will include a Blazor web version of the HabitTracker tool.
